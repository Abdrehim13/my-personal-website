  <h2> my highschool journey </h2>
  <p>My high school journey began with a bit of struggle in ninth grade, but by grade 10, I had significantly improved myself academically and personally. This transformation was evident when I achieved the highest score on my school's entrance exam, surpassing not only my peers within the institution but also those across the city. Alongside academic achievements, I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, notably participating in parliament and various school clubs such as the Unit for Success. Through these endeavors, I garnered more than 10 certificates, demonstrating not only my academic prowess but also my commitment to personal development and community involvement.</p>
